# Genomics and Bioinformatics Code Repository

Welcome to this repository, showcasing code and scripts developed and utilized during my Ph.D. and postdoctoral research in genomics and bioinformatics. This collection is organized for clarity and ease of navigation, providing practical examples of computational approaches in these fields.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into three primary sections:

1.  **Genomics:** Analyses related to genome-scale data.
2.  **Bioinformatics:** Computational pipelines for biological data analysis.
3.  **Data Processing:** Scripts for data preparation, cleaning, and formatting.

Each section contains subdirectories organized by specific projects and analytical tasks, facilitating efficient browsing.

## Technologies and Languages

The code in this repository primarily utilizes the following technologies and programming languages:

*   **Bash:** For shell scripting and command-line automation.
*   **R:** For statistical computing, data analysis, and visualization.

## Genomics

This section encompasses a range of genomics analyses, including:

*   **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):** Scripts and workflows for identifying genetic associations with traits.
*   **Population Structure Analysis:** Implementation of STRUCTURE v2.3.4 (command-line version) for population stratification.
*   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Decay Analysis:** Methods for assessing LD patterns in populations.
*   **Population Genetics and Genetic Diversity Analysis:** Tools for evaluating genetic variation and population dynamics.
*   *(Future additions planned)*

## Bioinformatics

This section primarily features pipelines developed during my postdoctoral research at the Institute for Advancing Health Through Agriculture (IHA), Texas A&M AgriLife Research, College Station, TX. Key areas include:

### RNA and DNA Sequencing Analysis

*   **Read Mapping:** Scripts for aligning sequencing reads to reference genomes.
*   **Differential Gene Expression Analysis:** Pipelines for identifying differentially expressed genes.
*   **Alternative Splicing Analysis:** Tools for investigating alternative splicing events.

### Variant Calling

*   **Variant Identification and Characterization:** Utilizing GATK for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and other variant calling.

### Raw Sequencing Data Quality Control

*   **Data Integrity Assessment:** Methods for evaluating the quality and integrity of sequencing data.
*   **Low-Quality Read Filtering:** Procedures for removing low-quality reads to improve downstream analysis.

Scripts optimized for execution on the Texas A&M High Performance Research Computing (HPRC) cluster are included, accompanied by illustrative command-line examples.

## Data Processing

This section contains scripts for data manipulation tasks, such as:

*   Data cleaning and formatting for downstream analysis.
*   Data conversion between different formats.
*   Custom data processing workflows.
