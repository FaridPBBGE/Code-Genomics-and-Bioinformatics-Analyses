# Bioinformatics Pipelines for Postdoctoral Research @IHA-TAMU
This repository showcases bioinformatics analysis pipelines developed during my postdoctoral research at the Institute for Advancing Health Through Agriculture(IHA), Texas A&M AgriLife Research, College Station, TX.These pipelines cover the following tasks of bioinformatics analyses:
* **RNA and DNA sequencing analysis:** Mapping reads, identifying differentially expressed genes, and exploring alternative splicing events.
* **SNP calling:** Identifying and characterizing genetic variations.
* **Quality control of raw sequencing data:** Assessing data integrity and filtering low-quality reads.

These pipelines utilize scripting languages, including Bash, R, and Python. Scripts designed specifically for execution on the TAMU HPRC cluster are included, along with tools commands.
